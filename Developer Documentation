will work on formating for this soon

__init__(self, root, file_name): Initializes the application, sets up the menu, and loads the default file.
  

load_file(self): Loads the Excel file into a DataFrame and displays it in the Treeview.
  could be better and this will for sure die if the formatiing of the sheets change

save_file(self): Saves the current DataFrame back to the Excel file.
  works, will die if the format changes

show_table(self, df): Displays the DataFrame in the Treeview widget.
  current bugs: there is one column to the right that just doesnt have anything i think im too sabog to find out why rn

add_schedule(self): Allows users to add a new schedule via input dialogs.
  works pretty well, but the prompts sucks rn
  bug where in when you press cancel, yes it will cancel the operation, but you wont be able to add anymore
  I want to make it so when you add a schedule it shows up next to the same course codes scheds

edit_schedule(self): Allows users to edit selected schedules.
  same problems with add_schedule

suggest_merge(self): Suggests schedules for merging based on an enrollment threshold.
  ui could be a bit better

merge_schedules(self): Merges two selected schedules into one.
  scuffed, its shifted to the right, doesnt follow the format, and it doesnt delete the other

find_conflict(self): Checks for scheduling conflicts between schedules.
  o^2 run time i can not make this better
